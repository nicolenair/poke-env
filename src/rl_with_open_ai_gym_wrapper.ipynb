It enables us to train agents which play in the Pokemon Showdown environment using agents from keras-rl2.\n",

    "# General Libraries\n",
    "*numpy*: this is a common library used to manipulate arrays & perform array-wise operations etc.\n",
    "*tensorflow*: this is the library we use to train deep neural networks. We will perform deep reinforcement learning (not just reinforcement learning), so we require this library.\n",
    "*pandas*: this is a common library used to manipulate tables & dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# poke-env imports\n",
    " These imports help us to correspond with the Pokemon Showdown environment. \n",
    " \n",
    "*PlayerConfiguration*: a class that allows us to store simple attributes such as player username and password.\n",
    "*LocalhostServerConfiguration*: specifies which localhost we are using to specify our Pokemon-Showdown server. We can also use the main Pokemon-Showdown server (remote) but this would be increasing the burden on the main server which many people are using, so this is highly discouraged\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a base class called Player, from which Gen7EnvSinglePlayer, RandomPlayer and FrozenRLPlayer each inherit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gen7EnvSinglePlayer*: this is the class that will be the parent of our reinforcement learning agent class(later declared as SimpleRLPlayer that we will be using for training. It enables us to start battles on the Pokemon Showdown environment, update our neural network etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*RandomPlayer*: this is the class that will define players that take completely random moves at each step. It also functions as the parent of the MaxDamagePlayer class. The MaxDamagePlayer will take the move which causes **maximum** damage based on the base power of the move. This is not necessarily the best move in the long-term. Both RandomPlayer and MaxDamagePlayer are used as opponents to our SimpleRLPlayer during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FrozenRLPlayer*: Similar to RandomPlayer and MaxDamagePlayer, this player is used as an opponent to the SimpleRLPlayer during training. The FrozenRLPlayer is initialized using a pre-trained RL agent from a previous iteration of training the SimpleRLPlayer. Using this FrozenRLPlayer we can include some self-play in our implementation.\n",

    "# keras-rl imports\n",
    "These imports help us to correspond with keras-rl2 agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CEMAgent*, *DQNAgent*, *SARSAAgent*: These are self-explanatorily imports of each of the respective RL agents that we utilize. \n",
    "\n",
    "*rl.policy imports*: These help us to import different policies for our agents to follow. For example, an epsilon greedy policy means that our agent chooses the move that has the highest value, but chooses a random move with probability epsilon, to aid in exploration (vs the pure exploitation that would be undertaken by a greedy policy). The linear annealment allows us to decay epsilon (erring towards exploitation later in training).\n",
    "\n",
    "*rl.memory imports*: These help us to import different types of memory. For example, ddqn and sarsa use sequential memory, whilst cem uses episode parameter memory. (FINISH THIS EXPLANATION)\n",

    "# tensorflow imports\n",
    "The *tensorflow.keras* imports are self-explanatory for anyone who has used tensorflow. We are importing the different types of layers, models and optimizers. Here is a nice intro to keras, for those unfamiliar with it: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras-17c09e4f0eb2"

We require both of these things in order to select the next action, as well as to update our deep RL model weights. You will find it interesting to note that the FrozenRLPlayer has very similar methods to these two, and can be thought of as a simpler version of SimpleRLPlayer that has fixed weights, and cannot be updated or start battles.
